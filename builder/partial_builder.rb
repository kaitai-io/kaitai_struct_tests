# Common base for all compiled languages, which follow the same
# routine to achieve "partial compilation":
#
# 1. Get a full list of files to compile:
#   * list of "disposable" files, removal of which from compilation
#     might get a partial successful build (compiled/* and specs/*)
#   * list of "mandatory" files (typically, runtime and test unit
#     framework), which cannot be removed at all
# 2. Construct a project file with full list of files
# 3. Build that project file
# 4. If successful, we're done, woo-hoo
# 5. If failed:
#   * Parse project build to get list of files to remove from project
#     in attempt to get it to compile
#   * Build updated project file with these files removed
#   * Retry from step 3
